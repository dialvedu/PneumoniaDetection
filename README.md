# Pneumonia Detection

One of the most important aspects of healthcare, is a timely diagnosis of a disease, as it's easier to treat in early stages. This is not only appliable on cancer, but also in infections, along with other diseases.

Pneumonia is swelling or inflammation of the tissue in one or both lungs. It's usually caused by a bacterial infection, but it can also be caused by a virus. The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days. Common symptoms of pneumonia include cough, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, high temperature, sweating, shivering and chest pain, among others [1]. This disease can lead to death, so a prompt diagnosis can increase the chance of fast recovering and survival of the individual.

This is why I created this project for the detection of presence of a pneumonia infection from chest X-ray images, taken from the Kaggle database [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) of Paul Mooney](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
